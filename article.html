       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/10/google-sexual-harassment-shareholder-lawsuit-alphabet" target="_blank"> harassment allegations </a>  at Google to the apparent biases encoded in artificial intelligence algorithms, the tech industry’s sexism has recently been thrust into the public eye. While most of the conversation around sexism in tech criticizes the culture of Silicon Valley
       and surrounds big tech companies like Google and Facebook, the problem is actually deeper than that:
       the lack of women in computer science reaches back decades and is rooted in academia.

     <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;When computer science was established as its own distinct discipline, women were at the forefront of the industry. Programming was seen as an easy, lowly job — and with the sexism of the 60s, women were quickly funneled into the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/computer-programming-used-to-be-womens-work-718061/" target="_blank"> field</a>. As a result, in 1984, <a href=" https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d12/tables/dt12_349.asp" target="_blank"> 37 percent</a> of undergraduate computer science students were women. But as the tech industry grew more lucrative, engineering jobs shifted to a “higher caliber” and became better paid; consequently, the perception of technologists shifted. As men gained executive positions, many developed specific hiring criteria and cultivated workplace culture that sidelined women. This, when combined with the onset of the “personal computing” era that marketed
      <a href="https://qz.com/911737/silicon-valleys-gender-gap-is-the-result-of-computer-game-marketing-20-years-ago/" target="_blank"> video games </a>specifically to boys, meant that women were pushed out of the very industry that they once dominated. This exclusion is reflected in academia: by 2018, only
      <a href=" https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d12/tables/dt12_349.asp" target="_blank">18 percent</a> of computer science undergraduate students were women, an approximate 20 percent decrease from three decades earlier.
     <br><br></p>

     <p>
       &emsp;&emsp;While true that the exclusionary environment of the tech industry is a factor in the underrepresentation of women achieving computer science degrees, explicit sexism in academia remains one component that has repeatedly failed to surface and face reform. From 1973 to 2008, the University of Southern California’s introductory computer science classes used an image of Playboy model Lena Soderberg to teach engineers how to convert photographs to digital bits (the original JPEGs); this became
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/02/19/women-built-tech-industry-then-they-were-pushed-out/" target="_blank"> standard practice </a> for computer science departments worldwide, and Soderberg’s picture was the most widely used photo in image-processing research.
     <br><br></p>

     <p>
       &emsp;&emsp;The “role-model effect” could be one explanation for why women are dramatically underrepresented in computer science at all levels in academia; women account for just
       <a href=" https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/04/complex-role-gender-faculty-hiring" target="_blank"> 15 percent </a>of tenure-track faculty. Other research has shown that women are
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/technology/gender-gap-tech-computer-science.html" target="_blank"> less likely </a>to enter computer science — and stick with it — if they don’t have female role models, mentors, and collaborators. Jingyan Wang, who is currently pursuing a PhD in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, reflected on her undergraduate research experience where she worked on computational imaging under a female advisor. “I felt like I could relate more [to a woman] and felt that at that time, she was one of my role models”. Without efforts to systematically and categorically change the way we teach undergraduate computer science and increase the presence of female computer science professors, the underrepresentation of female undergraduate computer science students will endure.
     <br><br></p>

     <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;In response to the sexist nature CS-related academia, new forces have risen to fight both explicit and implicit gender bias. For example, Harvey Mudd College has begun to emphasize teaching over research by hiring and rewarding professors on the basis of their classroom performance, placing women in leadership positions, and redesigning its introductory computer science course. By 2017, 38 percent of its professors and six of the seven department chairs were female. The college’s efforts have translated to positive results, with 55 percent female undergraduate computer science students by 2016, an approximate
      <a href="https://qz.com/730290/harvey-mudd-college-took-on-gender-bias-and-now-more-than-half-its-computer-science-majors-are-women/" target="_blank"> 40 percent</a> increase from 7 years prior. Universities such as Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley have recently focused on increasing women in their electrical engineering and computer science programs. Both universities have restructured their preliminary computer science courses, designating one for those with no prior experience and another for those with coding experience. This effectively solves another issue in the field: the wide range of experience that undergraduate students have on entrance. Angela Jiang, who is currently pursuing a doctorate in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, noted this discrepancy. “Usually, going into computer science, you have a really wide spread of how much people know,” said Jiang. “Everybody’s on the same playing field for biology, for example, because you all took a high school class. With computer science, you have a lot of hobbyists but also people who haven’t done anything in high school. I was one of those people.”

       &emsp;&emsp;Stanford and UC Berkeley’s efforts have increased female representation in electrical engineering and computer science, reaching 31 percent and 22 percent female representation
       <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/04/16/forget-techs-bad-bros-stanford-berkeley-boost-female-computing-grad/" target="_blank"> in 2017 </a>respectively. Additionally, student groups such as Stanford Women in Computer Science and Berkeley’s Society of Women Engineers have created spaces for women in STEM to receive support and gain perspective from peers. Jingyan Wang, who graduated from UC Berkeley with an EECS degree before her PhD, enjoyed “mingling with other female students in computer science and engineering” as part of Berkeley’s Society of Women Engineers and said that it “was not something [she] had before college.”

       <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Since 1970, women have been consistently underrepresented in computer science PhD programs; however, as tech becomes increasingly intertwined with society, female representation in CS is paramount. “When I entered my PhD, I was one of 2 women out of the 12 people in my year,” said Wang. “Since [the other woman’s] advisor moved to a different university, the only other woman in the program also moved to the university with her advisor. Then it was only me in my year.”

        <br><br></p>

        <p>
         &emsp;&emsp;A study done by the National Bureau of Economic Research reveals that in doctorate cohorts with no female peers, women are 11.9 percentage points less likely to complete a PhD within <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25028.pdf" target="_blank"> 6 years </a>than their male counterparts. The lack of women earning PhDs in computer science not only impacts the future of research, but also employment. With the rising need for technical expertise, employers are increasingly including doctoral degrees in their minimum hiring requirements.

         <br><br></p>

         <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;In fact, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 15.3 percent jump in the number of jobs in CS requiring a doctorate degree by 2022. Both Jiang and Wang attested to this fact. “I think you need a PhD to even just get your foot in the door,” said Jiang. “A PhD is a much more well-rounded thing, and there are many more things you can do once you have it.” Wang spoke to a similar point, saying that “if you want to get a research position in industry, it’s kind of a required qualification to have a graduate degree.”

          <br><br></p>

          <p>
           &emsp;&emsp;If the number of women who earn PhDs in computer science is <a href="https://www.computerscience.org/degrees/phd/" target="_blank">so few </a>in comparison to the number of men, how will big tech companies reach gender equality among their employees in the future? To prevent an increase of underrepresentation of women in tech from becoming reality, universities should try to populate their doctorate programs with a more balanced ratio of female to male students.

           <br><br></p>

           <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Beyond equalizing the gender ratio of participants in computer science PhD programs lies the expanding sector of AI research that is expected to shape the world’s future. However, a look into AI’s shortcomings reveal another circle of tech where the lack of female representation within holds severe implications. Over the last two years, Amazon has aggressively marketed its facial recognition technology to police departments and federal agencies as a service to help law enforcement identify suspects more quickly. However, a recent study from researchers at MIT Media Lab found that Amazon’s system, Rekognition, had difficulty identifying female and darker-skinned faces. In fact, Rekognition misclassified women as men 19 percent of the time and mistook darker-skinned women for men 31 percent of the time; however, its error rate for identifying lighter-skinned males was around
            <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/ai-bias-how-to-fight-prejudice-in-artificial-intelligence.html" target="_blank">only 1 percent</a>. The
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/technology/amazon-facial-technology-study.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=Business" target="_blank">same phenomenon</a> was observed in other AI developed by tech companies such as IBM, Microsoft and Megvii. Amazon’s AI recruiting software was trained by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. Since most resumes came from men, reflecting the male dominance of tech, Amazon’s system taught itself that male candidates were more preferable. It
            <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G" target="_blank">penalized resumes</a> that included “women’s,” as in “women’s innovation society chair,” and downgraded all graduates of two all-women’s colleges. Although these companies quickly released more accurate technology, AI bias exists for one reason: AI is a reflection of its creator. According to researchers at NYU’s AI Now Institute, only 15 percent of AI research employees at Facebook and <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/16/researchers-say-bias-in-ai-a-crisis-linked-to-lack-of-tech-diversity/" target="_blank">10 percent</a> at Google are women. The lack of representation of women and people of color has led to the absence of diverse perspectives in the development of AI technologies and the continuation of historical patterns of discrimiation. If we don’t correct AI bias by diversifying the field of researchers, heavy moral implications come into play.

            <br><br></p>

            <p>
             &emsp;&emsp;Change begins from the ground up. Change must begin in academia in order to shift representation in industry. We need to encourage undergraduate universities to support institutional and systemic change to their computer science programs, so that women feel confident in pursuing the field, ultimately increasing the presence and participation of women in CS. In terms of graduate programs, increasing female representation in faculty to provide graduates with positive role models is vital. We must equalize and diversify the developing and ever-changing world of tech — before it’s too late.

             <br><br></p>

             <p>
              &emsp;&emsp;As to advice for budding female computer scientists? Wang says it best: “as long as you’re interested in something, you can do it well. Be yourself, pursue what you’re actually interested in and don’t compare yourself to others.”
